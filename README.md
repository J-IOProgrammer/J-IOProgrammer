I am IO_Programmer<br/>
I am very interested in learning🤩, programming👩‍💻, technology and astronomy. I remember saying, I also love math👩‍🏫, physics🙋‍♀️, chemistry👩‍🔬 and other sciences. In general, I can say that I love everything😍. In the meantime, I decided to become a senior Java😎 and then look for other interests.

Of course, I also love learning other programming languages. While I'm learning Java, I'm also learning Python🐍. I think learning Java and Python together is a very fun and enjoyable experience👌.

I also think about designing the site🌏, so I finished the HTML period and now I want to learn CSS and the rest of it🏁.

I also worked with Photoshop and learned it very well👩, and now I'm going to learn Illustrator so that I can design whatever design I like for my site🎉.

John Johnson:

Solve the problem first, then code.
